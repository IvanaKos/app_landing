Very good consistency with spacing in HTML and CSS, I like it.

Things that need to be improved are marked with TODO: comment above them.



TODO: Please change the file extension to .md. That is Markdown - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown. It is a standard in GitHub repositories and it can be easily parsed by GitHub, and offers some basic styling

TODO: In this file please add a brief description of the project. Maybe it would be useful to note down the folder and project structure.

TODO: You can delete the .gitignore file as it is empty and not used. Try to always keep only the things you use.

TODO: I would create a separate folder for CSS files and put reset.css and style.css in there

TODO: To organize your CSS further, you can utilize @import and decouple your CSS to the sections or logical parts: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_import_rule.asp

TODO: I would rename the Photos folder to assets (mind the casing of the folder name, try to keep it always in lower case), as have images, but also logos, icons, etc. You might also have fonts and other assets in there as well. You can easily group all of them as assets used by the website.

TODO: Please add a .prettierrc configuration file for the automatic code formatting: https://prettier.io/

TODO: I noticed some images have duplicate versions JPG and PNG. Please keep only the ones you need to use and delete the rest.

TODO: If you haven't please run all the JPGs and PNGs through an optimizer tool such as: https://tinypng.com/ to reduce the filesize.

TODO: We need to improve the section background images placement. I will show you how.
